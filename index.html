      <h1>BEST HORROR SCENES</h1>
      <h2>
        An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in horror.
      </h2>
      <p>
        “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
        most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
        may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
        necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror, and all
        have the same general effect: unease, dread, fear, shock, disgust.

        Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by Brandon
        Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is recommended
        you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

                  I became an instant fan of Lars von Trier’s when I discovered
                  his early film Europa (1991). Shortly after watching that
                  film, Breaking the Waves (1996) was released and created a
                  frenzy around him and star Emily Watson (making her theatrical
                  film debut), who went on to be nominated for an Academy Award
                  for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Breaking the Waves is a
                  near-perfect film for me, but as with most of his projects,
                  Trier made headlines with controversial statements like, “I
                  was determined to write a story that was so far-fetched and so
                  full of clichés that no one could take it seriously, but of
                  course the audience liked it. All you have to do is come up
                  with something really stupid, and it will become a great
                  success.” I’ve learned not to pay too close attention to
                  anything he says about his own films. But when I heard that he
                  was making a Horror film, and that he wrote and directed it
                  while hospitalized for depression, and that it stars Willem
                  Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg, I found myself once again
                  reading interviews with Trier to learn more. I was seeing
                  comments like, “I watched a documentary where the forests were
                  portrayed as a place of great pain and suffering as the
                  different species tried to kill and eat each other. I was
                  fascinated by the contrast between this and the view of nature
                  as a romantic and peaceful place. At the same time that we
                  hang it on our walls over the fireplace or whatever, it
                  represents pure Hell.” I was intrigued. Antichrist is far from
                  a perfect film. In some ways I wonder if it should ever have
                  left Trier’s brain (which could be said about many of his
                  films). I think Trier’s films are made up of so many
                  incredible and unique parts that sometimes don’t always fit
                  perfectly together, but those parts are so good that it’s
                  usually easily forgiven. Antichrist is a deeply personal and
                  original vision. It doesn’t always work, and sometimes it’s
                  difficult to know if you’re expected to be horrified or to
                  laugh (chaos reigns…), but because so many of the parts are so
                  astoundingly beautiful and original, I feel it’s definitely
                  worth a viewing. Be warned, though. There is good reason I
                  blocked out most of the picture in the clip I chose.
